# cub3d

First-person 3D representation of a maze using raycasting, similar to Wolfenstein 3D (1992).

## Final grade : 105/115

Mandatory part : 100/100

Bonus : 5/15


### The game

Just like B.J. Blazkowicz in Wolfenstein 3D, you have infiltrated a nazi stronghold.

You got what you needed, but you won't get out unnoticed. You're gonna have to fight your way out !

You should be able to survive if you get to the third floor, and kill everyone there. Good luck !

### How to run it

Using ``make`` will build the executable and run it (it works on linux)

To run it again without remaking, you can simply run the executable with ``./cub3D``.

### Controls

You can move around the maze with ``W`` ``A`` ``S`` ``D``.

You can also rotate the view with the directional arrows ``←`` and ``→``.

To exit the game, press ``ESC`` or click the red cross.

### The mandatory part

The basic program that was required to pass. It only includes wall textures and a sprite ; no floor/ceiling textures, no weapons, no enemies, no game elements at all.
